## Research Aim and Goals

### Motivation

The unprecedented surge in post-pandemic inflation across Europe has triggered intense debate about the underlying drivers—particularly the respective roles of **corporate profit margins**, input costs, and macroeconomic shocks. In the Czech Republic, as elsewhere, policymakers and economists have questioned to what extent inflation can be attributed to “greedflation” (firms expanding margins), as opposed to cost-push or demand-side factors. There is a pressing need for **firm-level evidence** that can disentangle these mechanisms and provide actionable insights for monetary, fiscal, and competition policy.

### Data and Sources

To address this, we assemble a **novel, merged dataset** at the firm-year level covering virtually the entire population of Czech firms above 10 employees over 2000–2023. This dataset uniquely combines:

* **Firm financial statements** from MagnusWeb (balance sheets, income statements, firm characteristics), structured as a wide firm-year panel.
* **Sector-level indicators** (producer price indices, sectoral wage and employment series) from the Czech Statistical Office (CZSO), harmonized to the NACE classification and filled via hierarchical propagation for maximum coverage.
* **Macro-level indicators** from the OECD Economic Outlook, CNB, and Eurostat—capturing fiscal stance, output gap, cost shocks, exchange rates, labor market slack, and headline/core inflation.

All sources are merged on a **firm-year basis** (with sectoral and macro controls), creating a high-dimensional panel suitable for advanced econometric analysis.

### Research Objectives

The main objective is to **quantify the relationship between firm-level profit margins and aggregate inflation dynamics** in the Czech Republic, with a focus on the following research questions:

* **To what extent have changes in operating profit margins at the firm and sector level contributed to inflation, particularly during inflationary spikes?**
* **How do macroeconomic shocks (cost-push, demand-pull, exchange rate, fiscal stance) affect the pass-through of input costs to final prices and margins?**
* **Are there systematic differences across sectors or firm types in the inflation-profit-margin relationship?**

### Methodological Approach

To address these questions, we employ a range of **panel data econometric models**, including but not limited to:

* **Fixed effects panel regressions** (at firm and sector level), controlling for sector and year heterogeneity.
* **Dynamic panel models** (e.g., Arellano-Bond GMM) to capture persistence and address endogeneity.
* **Event study and difference-in-differences designs** around major macroeconomic shocks (e.g., energy crisis, pandemic years).
* **Variance decomposition** and **Blinder-Oaxaca style accounting** to separate price vs. margin contributions to inflation.
* **Robustness checks** using alternative margin definitions, cost variables, and sectoral aggregations.

### Expected Contribution

The study aims to deliver the **first rigorous, bottom-up quantification of the margin–inflation nexus** in a Central European economy, leveraging full-population firm-level data and rich macro controls. The results are intended to inform both academic debate and practical policy design on inflation control, competition, and profit monitoring.
